In early December, Republicans in the State House introduced a transphobic and misogynistic bathroom bill. If HB1442 were to pass, transgender women would be prohibited from entering women's restrooms in both public and private institutions, making it a trespassing misdemeanor, putting a permanent mark on their record which would make employment and various other aspects of life more difficult for trans women. Make no mistake: This is yet another open attempt to push transgender individuals out of public life entirely.

This bill, the latest in attacks against the transgender community, not only harms gender non-conforming individuals but also cisgender people. There have already been stories from other states that have passed bathroom bills from cis individuals who quote-unquote, *“didn't pass”* and were the victim of questioning and harassment by people trying to uphold those laws. While other states have enacted legislation regarding bathrooms, what makes New Hampshire’s proposed bill unique is that it applies to private businesses as well. This is a gross overreach of government power over bodily autonomy in a state that supposedly prides itself on the motto *“Live Free Or Die.”* Trans people are just trying to live their lives and have the same bodily needs as everyone else. For a state that postures itself to care so much about individual liberties, our lawmakers sure do enjoy enacting authoritarian policies to police people's bodies.

In addition to the overt transphobia in the proposed legislation, it is also deeply misogynistic, as it only applies to trans women, which also means it perpetuates the erasure of trans men, who constitute roughly half of the trans population. Trans women already face enough discrimination in both public and private life, and this bill only serves to inflict more cruelty and ostracization of the demographic. Feeling unsafe in public bathrooms, and even being barred from entering their preferred restroom, is a primary reason why transgender people suffer from much higher rates of urinary tract infections than the rest of the population, as many individuals would rather hold it in than enter a public restroom. Section 1e of the bill, as well as other proposed bills, also stipulates that prisons be segregated based on assigned gender at birth, but this too will only harm the trans community, as trans women, especially trans women of color, have among the highest rates of being the victims of sexual assault. Being a woman in a men's prison would needlessly increase that risk.

Time and time again, politicians from both parties have shown their ignorance and bigotry about transgender, non-binary, and intersex people, repeatedly conflating sex and gender, misunderstanding the fluidity of human anatomy, and a flagrant disregard for the history of gender non-conforming individuals. Sex and gender do not refer to the same thing, and both have varying degrees of fluidity. 1.7% of people are intersex, and bills like this completely disregard the differences in sex and chromosomes, even among people supposedly of the *“same sex.”* Every state representative who votes for HB1442, or any other transphobic legislation, should be voted out of office during the next election.

While HB1442 is certainly the most egregious of the proposed bills, it isn't the only upcoming piece of legislation targeting the queer community. Some examples include HB1132 which prohibits the display of pride flags in schools; HB1165, which prevents the altering of gender markers on government identification materials; and multiple House and Senate bills restricting trans people in sports, locker rooms, changing rooms, and prisons (HB1299, HB1447, SB459, SB552).

We must resist the passing of these bills with every tool we have: Call and write your representatives, protest, share information and resources, educate people on the harms of anti-trans legislation. Trans solidarity is class solidarity.
