    <h3>Nashua Free Store</h3>
    <p>The Nashua Free Store is up and running! We run every Sunday from 3-4pm by the Nashua Public Library near the main parking lot. Donate items such as clothing, food, hand warmers toiletries, hygiene products, tents, and sleeping bags. You can leave items at our drop boxes at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eNwZFLw8yF3F2h1M7">Coffee and Kindness</a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qceu2BrW4uZyBKmF6">Tangled Roots</a> on West Pearl Street.

    <h3>Trans Clothing Swap</h3>
    <p>The Trans Clothing Swap is a mutual aid initiative held on the third Saturday of every month at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uft9QaamygZxirwW7">Universalist Unitarian Church</a>. You can find the times in our <a href="/calendar/">event calendar</a>. New Hampshire is home to the fifth-highest percentage of queer individuals in the country, yet the community faces continuous attacks from reactionary politicians. In addition, with one of the lowest minimum wages in the nation, the financial burden of transitioning becomes even more prohibitive. Under capitalism, many trans individuals are forced to depend on their employers to determine whether they can afford to live as their authentic selves, a reality faced by thousands of trans people across the United States.</p>
    <p>The Trans Clothing Swap seeks to mitigate this challenge by providing free gender-affirming clothing in a welcoming, judgment-free space, helping to ease some of the financial barriers associated with transitioning. Beyond clothing distribution, we aim to use this event as a platform to foster a supportive community for trans individuals in the Manchester area. In a society that often isolates us, it is crucial that we build solidarity and stand together. By coming together, we strengthen our collective power and resilience to the fascist threat.</p>

    <h3>Helping Local Labor Unions Organize</h3>
    <p>We are currently working with Starbucks Workers United (SBWU) and their locals in the area to fight against the hundreds of unresolved unfair labor practice charges on unionized baristas by Starbucks. SBWU's baristas are fighting to win workplace protections on core issues like respect, living wages, racial and gender equity, and fair scheduling. Stand with them, and donate to their strike fund if you can!</p>
