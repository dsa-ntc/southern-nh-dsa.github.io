<h3>Queer Socialist Working Group</h3>

The Queer Socialist Working Group is the center for all queer organizing in the DSA. We recognize how members of the LGBTQIA+ community face unique challenges under capitalism, all in the ruling class’s plan to enforce the nuclear family and produce workers subservient to the bosses. Any expression or sexuality that deviates from this patriarchal model is often met with suppression, as well as discrimination and gatekeeping in the workplace, housing, insurance, medical care, adoptions, and communities.

The modern LGBTQ movement, while admirable as a whole, has been co-opted by liberal acquiescence to capitalism. We believe in a movement that will reject what has caused us harm altogether. Fighting these at the capitalist root will mean queer and trans liberation.

Our group is open to all comrades of the LGBTQ community and its allies. Our events include a monthly trans clothing swap on the third Saturday of each month, protests, queer theory discussions, and more. Join us to fight for true queer and trans liberation together!

<h3>Trans Rights and Bodily Autonomy Working Group</h3>

Dedicated to protecting healthcare access and protections for our trans population, our Trans Rights and Bodily Autonomy Working Group is always looking for help on how to meet people's needs.

<h3>Palestine Working Group</h3>

Our newest working group, the Palestine working group is dedicated to showing solidarity to the Palestinian people in a state rife with companies that make millions of dollars on their destruction.

<h3>Immigration Rights Working Group</h3>

IRWG was founded to push forward our Avelo Boycott, and is continuing that campaign until Avelo ends its contract with ICE. Avelo isn't the only thing that IRWG organizes around, there are plenty of ways for a member to get involved!

<h3>Communications Committee</h3>

The Communications Committee is responsible for overseeing the chapter's social media platforms and all communication efforts within the organization. This includes drafting and distributing a comprehensive monthly bulletin that provides an overview of the chapter's activities, initiatives, and key developments. In addition, the committee actively seeks opportunities to collaborate with other leftist organizations and groups, with the goal of fostering strategic partnerships and strengthening our coalition to advance shared objectives and expand our collective impact.

<h3>Membership Committee</h3>

The Membership Committee focuses on organizing and engaging SNH DSA members. The committee handles member education, roster management, and social event planning. It also coordinates with other committees to direct members to activities and projects that align with their interests.

<h3>Fundraising Committee</h3>

The Fundraising Committee develops and implements strategies to raise funds for the chapter. This includes organizing events and other initiatives to generate revenue. The committee ensures that the chapter has the necessary resources to succeed in its organizing efforts and advance the overall mission of a more just future.

<h3>Political Education Committee</h3>

Our Poli Ed group puts together resources and trainings for chapter members to learn from, discuss, and empower themselves with.
