    <p> If you are ready to organize with Southern NH DSA, the first step is to join National DSA. Pay your dues (please select monthly) and join 70,000+ members in the struggle for a better world. No one will be turned away for lack of funds–anyone who wants to join but cannot afford to contribute financially should complete this dues waiver form. </p>
    <p> If you intend to become a member of the SNHDSA chapter, please also reach out to us via email, southernnhdsa@gmail.com you can forward your dues payment receipt from Nationals if you already have it. We'll help you get onboarded and organizing! </p>
